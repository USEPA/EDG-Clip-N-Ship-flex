# EDG-Clip-N-Ship-flex

This is the source code for the EPA's Enterprise Dataset Gateway Clip and Ship Application:
https://edg.epa.gov/clipship/

The application was built around the Esri developer sample:
http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisserver/9.3/dotNet/geoprocessing/gp_ser-1598051580.htm
with extensive customization to automate the data loading process, and configure links to metadata and meaningful popups.

Source code for the flex-based web application may be found in the flex-code folder, while the python scripts, toolbox, templates and deployment documents may be found in the scripts-tools folder.

The code is made available as-is, with no support or warranty, and there are no plans for further development at this time. The public is welcome to fork and reuse the code, and acknowledgement of the EPA would be appreciated.
